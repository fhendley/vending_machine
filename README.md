# vending_machine
Virtual Vending Machine in JavaScript

This project runs in the command line, to run the virtual vending machine enter "node Vending_machine.js". It requires the node_modules folder to be added before the program is able to run.

The program is case sensitive e.g. when asked a question enter either "yes" or "no" with no capitals.

This also applies when asked for a code for the project, ensure that the letter of the code is a capital letter e.g. "A1" rather than "a1".
